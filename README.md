# College Event Management System 
# College Event Management System using DBMS

This project is a College Event Management System that uses a Database Management System (DBMS) to efficiently manage events, participant registrations, and resources. It allows event organizers to create and schedule events, track participants, and manage event resources. The system also provides reporting features for analyzing past events. This repository includes the database schema for managing event data, user roles, and resources. 

### Features:
- Event creation and management
- Participant registration
- Resource allocation
- Reporting and analytics
Feel free to explore the schema and contribute!

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the contributors and open-source community for their valuable resources and support. Special thanks to everyone who helped in designing and implementing the College Event Management System. Your efforts in creating, improving, and sharing knowledge have been instrumental in making this project possible.
Additionally, we acknowledge the use of DBMS technologies and frameworks that have enabled the development of this system, making it scalable and efficient for managing college events.

## Abstract
This project is an Event management portal that is implemented on a website. This project gives feature of remotely creating, removing, information retrieval, allotting tasks to different participants, etc in an event. This project is capable of providing all the important access to the admin and all the people related to a particular event. It gives Event Manager access to see participants and guest list. Also, he/she will be able to create or delete an event. This project will reduce paperwork and manpower hence creating a hassle-free way of managing an event. Every event requirement will be traceable. One would be able to collect feedback from people and improve according to that feedback. Volunteer can be invited and duties can be assigned to them also revenue collection can be monitored through this platform. The purpose 
of creating this project is to digitalize the processes involved in an event, also it is easy to access so one can access it anytime and anywhere and perform a manage an event. It provides most of the basic functionality required by any event manager to smoothly run the event. This is to satisfy the needs of event manager as well as participants of event. They can enter their data and register for the event. This data is then sent to administrator which in turn can contact the participants. This project belons to the category DBMS (Data Base Management System). The project is based on JAVA (GUI (Graphical User Interface)) and MYSQL.

## Implementation
College event management System is the application to manage and development of festivals, events and conferences. Proposed work involves study of identifying the target of budget, cost, and analysis. Post event analysis and ensuring a return on investment have become significant drivers for the event industry. This is an online College event management system, software project that serves the functionality of an event manager. The project provides most of the basic functionality required for an event. This web-based application system can be implemented in any place for booking events. 
The system can also be used as software to promote the entire booking places. The user gets all the resources at a single place instead of wondering round for these. This system is effective and saves time and cost of the user. Functionally Performed by Admin, Participant and Faculty:
